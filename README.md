I am a PhD student at German Aerospace Center (DLR), Germany. My current work focuses on spatiotemporal characterization and monitoring of drought hazards and landuse changes using earth observation time-series data. I am also interested in remote sensing machine learning/deep learning to monitor and characterize environment-related changes.
